        <p>'Ello, Mates! Let me tell you about myself.  I am a stay-at-home-mom.  I have two children, ages 3 and 2.
            My husband is in the military, so that makes for an interesting life. I love learning new things and computers are my
            current hobby, so when this programming class isn't giving me a headache, I do enjoy it. </p>
        <p>I am a gamer, in my free time, and love to get together with my group of nerds to play games and just talk.
            They are great at helping me just balance my mind in this crazy life. When its not raining we love to get out and
            enjoy nature, especially, the ocean.</p>
        <p>I can't wait to get to know you and see if we can all survive this course.</p>
